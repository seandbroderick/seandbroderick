This week I spent much time just honing in my skills. Going into this class I knew I would be seing alot of content I had seen before, but this provides me an opprotunity to describe what I know with proper terms,
this is definatley better than me understanding what something does, but having no clue where to start when explaining such understanding. I also specfically learned that Global Variables are undersireable in almost all cases.
Good to know.
